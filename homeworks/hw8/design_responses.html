				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I know some functions of websites when using them but I did not take the time
							to think about their designs. Now it all makes sense to me that this special designs
						has forced users to follow certain behaviors that benefit the companies who designed the website. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I like how it talks about different black patterns. I hate most of them so I really enjoy reading the article
							discussing these designs. Dark patterns are indeed very tricky and they are improving to trick more people.
						I like how the article highlighted that privacy, honesty and respect should be the core elements.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> Yes, the info in the blogs is bad, false, and misleading but the rationale is that â€˜if it gets the people to click on it and engage, then use it </p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a
							five, please briefly explain why.</p>
						<p> 10</p>
