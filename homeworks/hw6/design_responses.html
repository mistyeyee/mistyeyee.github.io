					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I need to avoid using bouncing effect since it distracts attention and using motion blur since they will distract users' attention.
								Optimal speed for interface animation is between 200 and 500 ms. Different movement types should have different speed. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favortie part of this article is that it combines words with vivid illustration. It is very clear in terms of 
								illustrating animations and how bad interactions can impact users'sexperience. I think I have improved my general sense of 
							what kind of automations to choose to fit multiple different purposes.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Animation is more of an art than science, so it's better to experiment and test your decisions on users </p>
