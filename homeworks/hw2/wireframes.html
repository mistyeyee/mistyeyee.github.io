					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> National Geographic </p>
							<img class="img-scaled", src="assets/imgs/myframe.png" />
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p> National Geographic reframed </p>
							<img class="img-scaled", src="assets/imgs/reframe.png" />
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of the website is to inform readers of current stories of the nature. It is intended for people who 
								care about natural world and who are interested to learn about their environment. The design is visually appealing
							    and divides section well so that readers know how to find the information they need. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p>  The repetition of subscription options and the arrangement of the tool bar. It seems that the website intentionally put twice the subscription button
								but I am thinking it may disrupt readers' browing mood. Hence, I resigned the button and reformat the whole bar under the logo
							    so that the audiences will clearly know if they want to subscribe or not. If not, they can just continue reading.  </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
