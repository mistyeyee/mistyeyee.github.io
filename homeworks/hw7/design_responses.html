						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I think it is really helpful to learn the different UI design principles. Different 
								design can impact how users feel about the layout of the page and 
							how to make the page more visually appealing and 'make sense' to view. 
						    For instance, similar patterns will allow users to learn that these elements
						    are related to each other and they may have similat functions. It reduces the thinking time for 
						users and easier to navigate. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really like that it introduces various principles. I especially like the part when it talks about
								closure and reification where an object is incomplete but still people can recognise object. It's amazing 
							how people are able to brige the gap using brain. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “The whole is other than the sum of the parts.”
