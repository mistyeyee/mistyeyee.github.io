            Hi! I am a Junior who loves Matcha, Studio Ghibli, and spending time in nature. 
            I mostly listen to Pop, acoustic, and R&B. 
            (Some of my favorite artists: Eason Chan, Christopher Nissen, Sam Kim.)

                <li> We may try to think like a designer: how to find the best wording and structure so that 
                    audiences feel comfortable navigating the website/app. The size and asthetics of the letters
                also tell different stories and that decide how people spread their attention.</li>
                <li> I like how the article uses live examples to demonstrates their points. It makes readers
                    easier to understand and to follow their thoughts.</li>
                <li> Why would someone open this app? What problem does it solve? 
                    How could the design help to solve that problem even better?</li>
