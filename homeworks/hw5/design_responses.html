                            <p> I gained some design inspirations from the article and what elements. It was amazing to 
                                see how various design elements are chosen to fit the needs of different companies/startups. I like the visuals. </p>

                            <p> Vivid visuals. How they utilize multiple examples to demonstrate their inspirations. The variety of instances. </p>

                            <p> My favorite is the Dark. I really like how they use the hover over function to make the image mysterious and I kind of need to 
                                explore by my own.(by moving my cursor to see what's in the background) The words Dark also hides behind the cave, I think it also kind of 
                            creates an atmosphere being that audiences are viewing from the other side of the cave. The main character is highlighted in the figure. The color scheme is also 
                        well-chosen. The navigation bar is concise. </p>
